# Advent of Code 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is a set of just for fun programming puzzles, with 50 puzzles released over 25 days. This is the repo for my solutions to these puzzles. If you haven't solved these yet, avoid spoilers by avoiding looking at the source code.

###Programming Language
These puzzles can be solved in any language. This year, I chose Rust. Why? Because I'm learning the language for fun, so why not. Of course, I'm in the very early stages of learning Rust, and that will show in this codebase. I'd like to think that I'm improving as I progress through the puzzles.

### Running the code
You will need to have Rust installed
* Clone the Repo
* cd into the advent directory
* Specify which day's puzzles you want to solve as command line arguments. You can specify multiple days
  * `cargo run day1 day2 day3`
  * `cargo run day16`
  * `cargo run day7 day11 day13 day17`
