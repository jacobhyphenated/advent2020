/*
  Day 11: Seating System

  The seating area is represented with empty spaces (.) or chairs that are empty (L) or occupied (#).
  All spaces update simultaneously each round.

  Part 1
  People choose where to sit given a set of rules:
    If a seat is empty (L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it, the seat becomes occupied.
    If a seat is occupied (#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are also occupied, the seat becomes empty.
    Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.
  Repeat these steps each round until the there are no changes to the seating arrangments between rounds.
  How many seats end up occupied?

  Part 2
  Instead of considering the 8 immediately adjacent seats, people instead consider the first seat they can see in each direction.
  Example: given the below layout, the empty seat would see 8 occupied seats:
    .......#.
    ...#.....
    .#.......
    .........
    ..#L....#
    ....#....
    .........
    #........
    ...#.....
  It now takes five or more visible occupied seats for an occupied seat to become empty.
  The other rules still apply.
  Given the new visibility method and the rule change for occupied seats becoming empty, once equilibrium is reached, how many seats end up occupied?
